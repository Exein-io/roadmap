# roadmap
## Overview

:rocket: Welcome to the [official Exein product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Exein-io/projects/9)!

The roadmap repository is for communicating Exein’s roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we will keep the roadmap private for the time being. We might open source our roadmap in the future if we see potential to engage more users in discussions about the future of Exein products and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository, such as how the issues are presented, use the [roadmap discussions](https://github.com/Exein-io/roadmap/discussions) to share them with the team.

## **Guide to the roadmap**

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
- A **product** that indicates the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product, see below.
- A **feature scope** that indicates whether the feature will be delivered **open source** or as a **commercial** module.
- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant resource.

### **Release phases**

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*
    
    Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.
    
- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*
    
    Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.
    
- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*
    
    Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.
    

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in design: ***Feature in discovery phase*
    
    We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out *how*.
    
- **exploring:** *Feature under consideration*
    
    We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.
    

### Product

The following is a list of our current products, with distinct labels for filtering:

- **cosmo:** Cosmo features
- **pulsar:** Pulsar features
- **shoto:** Shoto features

*More labels will be added in the future as needed.*
